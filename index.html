    <h2>Our Little Story 🌸</h2>

    <p>
      One quiet afternoon, I was standing in the corridor, watching people laugh,
      giggle, and enjoy their moments. At that time, I truly believed my life was
      meant to be lonely, and I had almost given up hope of ever finding my soulmate.
    </p>

    <p>
      But when I least expected it, you walked into my life — so unexpectedly,
      yet so perfectly. In that very moment, you filled my world with happiness.
      Talking to you that day felt incredibly special, especially because you chose
      to come to me when you could have been with anyone else.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am endlessly grateful for everything that brought us together, and I promise
      to cherish you for the rest of my life. I love you so much, my sweetheart,
      my darling, my princess, my Rapunzel, my Ammu.
    </p>

    <p class="story-ending">
      Wishing you the happiest birthday, my love.
      Stay happy, stay blessed, and let’s grow old together 💗
    </p>
